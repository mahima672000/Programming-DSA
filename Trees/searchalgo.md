Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. 
It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.



Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) 
and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
